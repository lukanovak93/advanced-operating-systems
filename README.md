Lab assignments from Advanced Operating Systems course @ FER, UNIZG

  1. digital_envelope.py is a digital envelope implementation using AES algorithm for data encryption and RSA algorithm for encryption key encryption
  2. digital_signautre.py is an implementation of the digital signature that uses RSA algorithm to ensure integrity of the message
  3. digital_seal.py is a program that encapsulates both digital_envelope.py and digital_signature.py
  4. SHA1.py is an implementation of sha1 hashing algorithm
